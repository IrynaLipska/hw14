            React Native is an open source framework for building Android and
            iOS applications using React and the app platform’s native
            capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
            platform’s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior
            of your UI using React components:
            <span class="italic"> of reusable, nestable code</span>. You can
            learn more about React in the next section. But first, let’s cover
            how components work in React Native.

            React Native runs on <span class="underline">React</span>, a popular
            open source library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To
            make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself.
            This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.

            We’re going to cover the core concepts behind React:

          <section class="section_text">
            <span class="bold">+ components.</span> The rest of this
            introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
            approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
          </section>
          <section class="section_text">
            <span class="bold">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a
            syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
            <span class="background_color"
              >&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</span
            >.
          </section>
          <section class="section_text">
            The React docs have
            <span class="underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can
            refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use
            variables inside it. Here you are declaring a
            <span class="background_color">name</span> for the cat, name, and
            embedding it with curly braces inside
            <span class="background_color">&lt;Text&gt;</span>
          </section>
          <section class="section_text">
            <span class="bold">+ props.</span> Props is short for “properties”.
          </section>
          <section class="section_text">
            <span class="bold">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as
            arguments you use to configure how components render, state is like
            a component’s personal data storage. State is useful for handling
            data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction.
            State gives your components memory!

            TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It
            has an <span class="italic">onChangeText</span> prop that takes a
            function to be called every time the text changed, and an
            onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the
            text is submitted.

            For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
            their words into a different language. In this new language, every
            single word is written the same way: 🍕. So the sentence "Hello
            there Bob" would be translated as "🍕 🍕".
